## 1. Project Overview :smile:
I embarked on this project with the ambitious goal of building a YouTube clone using only HTML and CSS. The journey turned out to be more rewarding than I could have imagined. Not only did I successfully create the app, but I also made it responsive, ensuring that it would seamlessly adapt to the user's browser window size. This project provided me with a deep dive into web page layout and positioning techniques, enriching my understanding of these essential elements.

## 3. Why I built this :hammer:
This project was second of three that I developed to assess my comprehension of CSS and HTML before advancing to JavaScript. These projects allowed me to apply my understanding of these fundamental web development languages and gain hands-on experience in creating responsive web pages.


## 4. what I learned building this project.
- Creating the layout proved to be the most challenging aspect of this project especially the left nav. It taught me about the trade-offs between employing sticky and fixed position values on an element. The decision to use one or the other can ultimately make or break your layout. 

- **Tackling responsiveness with media queries:** Mastering responsiveness through media queries, I gained proficiency in utilizing media queries and the display property to craft webpages that dynamically adjust based on the user's browser window size.
- **Securing responsiveness through the Grid Layout:** In addition to utilizing media queries for responsiveness, I incorporated the Grid Layout, employing a combination of autofit and minmax functions to create a responsive grid.
